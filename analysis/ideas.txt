mean value of peak processing - interpolate for peak
run with limited processor power - effect on mean execution time --- stepwise increment- graph mean exe time
spread by per second
mean curve with error bars
make run lines fainter and mean line bold
mean peak memory usage
peak mean vs overall mean
candidates for descriptive of processor is mean usage and peak usage -set to just above/below mean and just above peak -compare execution time
--most impactful for 2nd program
change in execution time significant -- hypothesis test????
